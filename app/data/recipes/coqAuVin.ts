  "instructions": [
    "Place the chicken thighs and drumsticks in a medium-sized bowl and pour the wine (Pinot Noir), chicken stock, and (if using) the brandy over the top.",
    "Prep the vegetables.",
    "Add the bacon or Pancetta strips to a large, high-sided pan or braiser over medium-high heat. Cook until the bacon is crispy, about 8 minutes, then remove it from the pan with a slotted spoon.",
    "Remove the chicken from the wine marinade (save the wine) and dry the chicken with paper towels. Working in 2 batches if needed, place the chicken in the pan, skin side down. Sear until it is golden on both both sides (about 5 minutes on each side) and then remove the chicken. Pour all but 2 tablespoons of the bacon/chicken oil into a heatproof dish and set it aside.",
    "Add the sliced onion and carrots to the pan and let them cook until the onion is golden brown, about 7-8 minutes. Add the garlic cloves to the pan and let it cook for 1 minute.",
    "Push the vegetables to the side of the pan and add the tomato paste. Cook the tomato paste until it is fragrant and begins to darken. Pour the reserved wine marinade into the pan, scraping the bottom to remove any stuck-on bits.",
    "Nestle the chicken into the pan and sprinkle the fresh thyme over top. Cover the pan, turn the heat to low, and simmer for 20 minutes.",
    "Pour 1 tablespoon of the reserved oil (or use olive oil) into a large skillet. Add the mushrooms and saute over medium-high heat until brown, about 10 minutes.",
    "Rinse the pearl onions in water multiple times to get rid of the acidity.",
    "Add the pearl onions to the pan with the chicken and cook for 10 minutes more.",
    "Make beurre manie: In a small bowl mix together by hand the flour and softened butter.",
    "Remove the chicken from the pan then add the beurre manie. Stir it into the sauce and let it thicken. Season to taste with salt and pepper.",
    "Add the chicken back into the pan and top with the cooked bacon and mushrooms. Sprinkle with a little fresh thyme."
